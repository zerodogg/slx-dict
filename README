NAME
    slx-dict - A simple tool to look up words in the skolelinux en->no
    dictionary

SYNOPSIS
    slx-dict [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    slx-dict is a simple tool to look up words in the skolelinux en->no
    dictionary. It can take words on the commandline and using the
    interactive interface.

    Running slx-dict without any parameters starts the interactive
    interface.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help, --hjelp
        Display a commandline parameter summary.

    -o, -u, --oppdater, --update
        Update the dictionary to the last one available.

INTERACTIVE USAGE
    The interactive mode of slx-dict works by typing in the English word or
    phrase and then pressing enter. Slx-dict will then reply the Norwegian
    translation of that word or phrase.

    You can also enter a Norwegian word or phrase to get the English version
    of that word or phrase by prefixing the line with an exclamation mark
    (!).

    You can also enter commands to slx-dict. The list of commands is below.

  INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
    Each command is prefixed by a hash sign (#).

    #help, #hjelp, #h
        Display a small help screen

    #quit, #exit, #q
        Quit slx-dict

    #upd, #oppd
        Update the dictionary (same as the -o commandline option).

NON-INTERACTIVE USAGE
    Non-interactive usage is very similar to interactive usage, with the
    notable exception that commands aren't available (but commandline
    arguments are). Note however that bash (the very comon shell) treats !
    in a special way so you will need to use it with single quotes ('').
    "slx-dict !word" won't work but "slx-dict '!word'" will.

REGULAR EXPRESSION SUPPORT
    slx-dict supports limited regular expressions. It supports ^ which
    indicates "at the beginning of the line", $ which indicates "at the end
    of the line" and ? which indicates that the preceeding letter does not
    need to be present. All whitespace is flexible. So a single space is the
    same as 100 spaces (in regex terms all whitespace is converted to one
    single \s+).

    Searching for: "^test" matches all lines *starting with* the word test.

    Searching for: "test$" matches all lines *ending with* the word test.

    Searching for: "conten?x?t" matches all lines containing the word
    "context", "content" or "contet".

    You can also mix characters in a single expression. Searching for:
    "controls?$" will match lines ending with control and controls. So it
    will result in both "controls" and "discretionary access control" while
    searching for "^controls?$" will only result in controls.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    slx-dict saves its data and configuration file to ~/.slxdict/.

    The configuration file is ~/.slxdict/slxdict.conf

  CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
    DictURL
        The full URL of to download the dictionary from. It defaults to
        *http://developer.skolelinux.no/~zerodogg/slx-dict/upd/dictionary*
        which is the official dictionary mirror as of this release.

    MaxRun
        The maximum amount of times slx-dict can be run before it
        automatically checks if there is an updated dictionary available.
        Defaults to 50.

    RunTimes
        The amount of times slx-dict has been run since the last dictionary
        update. This value is increased on every invocation of slx-dict. You
        usually don't need to change this value manually.

    NoVersionCheck
        This value is not in the configuration file by default but you can
        add it there manually. If it is set to any number other than 0
        slx-dict will not notify you about the availability of a new
        slx-dict release.
