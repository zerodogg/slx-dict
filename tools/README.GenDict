GenDict is the tool used to generate the slx-dict dictionaries from the
main html file.

Simply run ./GenDict to generate a dictionary. It requires perl, wget and html2text.

GenDict can take a single parameter, the file to write the dictionary to.
So ./GenDict ~/dictionary writes the dictionary to ~/dictionary.
